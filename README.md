Hello!
This is my second attempt at making a 3d Graphics/Game engine, this time, I have decided to do it in C to make it a little more challenging.
If you want to run it on your pc, I advise you to make a Makefile on your own (or to run it with gcc and the same librairies as in my makefile).
You can import your own 3d object into my Engine as long as it's format is .obj. To do so, you can change the path of the object in main.c .
There are still a lot of things to do but this version of my project works pretty well! Any advices to improve my code are welcome and have fun!

Feel free to use this code or modify it but please credit me if you do!

(please don't mind the AAAAAAA commit message I was having trouble with git)
